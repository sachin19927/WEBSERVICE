WEB SRECIVE INTRODUCTION


Pre-requirements


CORE JAVA
JAVA web application
Deploy Java web application



SOAP(JAX RPC and JAX WS jar) 
REST(JAX RS jar)


example of SBI and ICIC ATM communicate



Web service Architecture 1

WS is specification its not not an API it provide some set rules and communications  how to communicate

Ws communicate between 2 improper able applications

it has 6 components

1 WSDL ws description language
2 UDDI (optional)
3 SKELETON
4 STUB
5 SOAP protocol
6 HTTP protocol


take one Java based application with a CalSericev.java having method 
public int add(int i ,int j )
{
return i+j;
}
 this methods has to be called from C++ or c# application

 
 since client is is an c+++ application calling Java so can directly create object or call method so one WSDL file will be created in JAVA application
 WSDL is noting but a XML file its an universal language can read from any application
 it contains class name, method name , parameter type and return type and also end point URL`(location of the service running)
WS a/c is having UDDI i.e UDDI registration software  the service provider will store the WSDL file which will be having unique name
unique name will be share to client and also send the location of UDDI file 
WSDL file will be received by client by using Unique name client send unique name to UDDI
client will get WSDL file using WSDL(xml) file client will generate some process called  STUBS or proxies using some stub generation tool
STUB will create a class client is c+ application stub will create C++ class if C3 then C# class
what ever method present in java server side method same will be available in STUB class
method will be same but implemention will be diff but finally method will be same
After generating STUB client will create a an object of STUB . invoke method and  pass parameter and add result type
now method calling is gone to STUB class .  Now STUB having method calling details and store it in XML formate  this is called SOAP request 
in SOAP request we have name of class, method,  parameter value and types
STUB is strong this XML (SOAP) because this XML document need to send to the service because it may be of any language so requested method should be understood to ur service applaiction
 

Web service Architecture 2


Why we call it has SOAP
because STUB uses some predefined tags to prepare this XML document that are called as SOAP tags.
SOAP is protocol which contains set of predefined tags STUB use tags to prepare the document
SOAP request need to be sent to service loactin
HTTP protocol move  SOAP requet from clint locatiion to   service side locaion 
SOAP request contain name of method parament values types
Server will revive the request 
Server will handle over this request to component called SKELETON
SKELETON is predefined class
if sevice calss is java skeleton is java class if it is C# calss then skelton is  C$ class
SKELTON class depends on Service Class 
SKEETON will take SOAP request skeleoton will read XML file to get name the method name, paramert vales n types  
SKELTON will invoke the clent requeted method on the acual service class by passing the values to the method 
SKELTON will get Return value as some integer value that need to be sent to cleint loacion
Againg SKELTON will prepare a XML document that will be SOAP response where it will store service and retrun value
SKELTON wil also use some predefined tags to prepare SOAP response and it will be service side loaction need to moved to client loaction again using HTTP protocl
HTTP is tranport protocol it moves from one location to another
SOAP response available to client loaction
STUb wil read the SOAP response value that value will be return to cleint    



WSDL is a XML which contains service class details  which is provided by service provider  to prepare WSDL we need WSDL generation tool
for WSDL generation tool to create WSDL file  input will be one is service class , we need to pass end point url.

WSDL will be used by client to kknow about your service details

UDDI will get WSDL file with unique name and its loaction 
UDDI is not mandtory if clinet alrdy know the WSDL file which he may got through the mail


Purpose of SOAP is SOAP is a protcoal conatins set of tags used by STUB to create a SOAP request  same tags used by SKLETOn to preapre SOAP responce
SOAP is messageing Prortol
HHTP is trportaion protocl
SKELTON is a predefined class

WHO will provide WSDL gernertion tool SKELTON prdefined class
if it is java SUN micro system will provide WSDL tool and SKELTON class


We need some API should be provided by platform


Who will provide STUB generation tool cleint is java then SUn microsystem will provide


JAVA WEB SERVICE API'S


JAX-RPC java  API for REmote prcedue call
JAX-M java API for XML messaging 
JAX-WS java API fro Ws
JAX-RS

all priveded buy SUN micro system

 two types of WEB services  
1 SYNCHRONOUS web serives (JAX-RPC,WS,RS)
2 ASYNCHORNOUS web serivice (JAX-M) 


example one WS is there client amde a request to the WS if WS take some time to provide  responce back to the client that is Called ASYNCHRONOUS WS
if client get immidate resoponse that will be the SYNCHONOUS WS
Cleint will never wait if it is ASYNCHRONUS WS


SYNCHONOUS WS again two types 

A) SOAP based WS(JAX-RPC,WS)
B) REST based WS (JAX-RS)


all this API are interface there is no implementation	

this API came with JDK version no need to download


Implementation for JAX-RPC

it is a specifiaction given by SUn microsystem along with JDK 1.4
we can develop both SOAP based WS and Client side WS

implementaion 

1 JAX-RPC-SI (sunmoicro Implementation) proviced API it is not along JDK we need to download this API
2 AXIS1 givien by APcahe foundation 3rd party need to download jar
3 WEB LOGIC Implementation BEE(ORACLE) with WEB logic SERver
4 WEB sphere implementaion by IBM 
5 JBOSS implementaion by REDHAT

all should provide WSDL generatte tool and SKELETON 


Implementation for JAX-WS

1 JAX-WS-RI (Referenece Implementation menase not fully implementaion by sun micro system now it is along with JDK 1.6)
2 METRO (sun micro system it is fully implemented) download separaly
3 AXIS2 apache foundation it doesnt support spring integration
4 APACHE CXF  it  support spring integration
5 WEB logic
6 WEb sphere
7 JBOSS
8 GLASS fish
	
Implementation for JAX-RS
 
1 JERSY sun micro system download
2 RESTEASY redHAT
3 RESRLET
4 APCHE CXF support SPring 
5 APACHE WINK dont support spring



JAX_M


we can develop asynchornous WS no body will develop asnychornuse stil we asnychrnous rhen go JMS (JAVA messaging Services)



SImple WEB SEVRCVICE AXIS1 calling using Eclpise

JAX-RPC applaiction

WS means a POJO calss means no interface extends or implements
CalService.java
public int add(int i,inj )
{
return i+j;
}

public int sub(int i,inj )
{
return i-j;
}


convert JAVA class as WS calss

this class should with in Web appliaction and deployed in Server
and inside web appliaction we need to configure SKELETON 
when request made it comes to SERVEr server idnetifies the SKELETON
SKELEOTON should be SERVLET and need to config servlet in WEB.xml file with some URL pattern



Generate WSDL file using WSDL tool and config SKELTOn all this step if u dont use IDE tool

client make a request when ever he amkes a request SOAP request along with SOAP request  he will send some other details thar nor not includeed in SOAP request
in SOAP request we only got method deatils like method name paramneter values and types exate will be the URL
ex http://localhost:8080/applaction-name/service/calServicementod

skeltonurl pattern will be congigured in WEB.xml file
ex /service/*

tis will be the pattern and u have to send the Unique name the service
it will be addition with SOAP request

this URL will be availbe in WSDL file aslo use clint will get the URL usig WSD file that will the end point URL of WS


provide unique name to SERVICE

to provide unique name to CAlservice.java   we need to creat one XMl file server-config.WSDL file inside this we will map ur service class with the Unique NAme

when request is made server will recive and SKLETON will look the URL and take the unique name in  to the congfig file so it verify if any service class mapped with unique name if it is mapped it will take taht class creat object and invoke method give resonse


Some compnet are common1 WSDL geenrtion tool, SKELETON, server-config.WSDl all provided by WS providers
configutionfile is mandantory but file name will be differtnt for implmentaion to another implemnetation

Configuration file used by the SKELTON to  identify the the SERvice class 
   
   
org.apache.axis.wsdl.java2WSDL  this class is given by AXIS1 implementation it is acting as WSDL genertion tool which genertae WSDL file
input will be service class and end point URL anme WSDL file target anem space of WSDL file then only WSDL will be created

org.apche.axis.transport.http.AxisServlet this class acting as AxisServlet need to configuerd in WEB.xml


Eclipse in built having AXIS 1 AXIS2 and APACHE CXF WS implmentation pluging wihche are all SOAP based  no REST based pluging in EClipse

ex if u want METRO ws u nedd to mannulay do all this steps

Got o eclpis and Start the steps for Axis 1

create an Dynmic Web Project

create A clss in The Project now We want create clss into WS 
follow steps
write clcik on the JAva file new-> other-> WEB service->web services

  there are 2 approaches Bottom Up approach and top up approach
  
  in bottom up approach we will create service class then convert into web service 
  in top down 2st we will devolve WSDL file and from there generate required user defined and service type class
  
  in configuration you can check you can change the server type and also WS type default inbuilt we have axis1 ,axis2 ,apache CFX
  
  finish  it now WSDL file will be created and also server-config.WSDl file will be created and SKELEOTON configuration will be done in WEB.xml with url pattern
  
  
  http://localhost:8081/CalCalutionService/services/CaslService    end ponit url
  
  http://localhost:8081/CalCalutionService/services/CaslService?wsdl   WSDL url
  
  
  
  AXIS 1 web Service Client using Eclipse
  
  2  types WS clients
  
  1 Proxy based  client 
  2 DII client (Dynamic Invocation Interface)

if WS client  generating STUB at client side and if the STUBS  client use to invoke WEBS is called  proxy based WS
in DII client never generate STUBS so that client will never use generated STUBS to invoke the WS 

in DII the WS provider will provide some set class which act as a STUB class that will use as in our application for WS



Client require WSDL file or WSDL URL from service provider  to create the WS client


WSDL file contains above the class name of the class method parameter type and return type and end point url

based on URL client generate STUB if is proxy based  client

client will develop a standalone alone web based application where  client will use generated stubs to invoke WS
  
 1 create a stand alone application 
 create java application 
we need to copy WSDL file  into project folder or WSDL url
generate Stubs
main method program there use stub to invoke the method
TestCLient.java 



create java project copy WSDL file
now generate  STUBS follow some rules 
generated STUB are java files so need to created in src folder only 
right click SRC-.NEW->OTHERR->web SERCVICE-> web service client -> browse WSDL file are URL of WSDL 

in WSDL file we have TargetNAmespace this Axis stub generation tool use this tagetnamespace to generate stub package at the client sides reverse order of tagetnamespace package will be crated in src of client application 

  
WSDL file having one binding tag that name will be the class name of STUB class in CLeint side

to create the Object of STUB class we need to have Constructor but already it is having constructor with URL and service as a parameter
before creating STUb object i need to create object java.net.URL object and Service object then by passing the 2 arguments we will get STUB object

Service is class given by Axis implementation 



AXIS 2 WS using Eclipse

AXIS 2 JAX-WS specification given by apache

eclipse has AXIS 1 AXIS 2 , APACHE CXF plug in but it has only jar fro AXIS 1
do we need to download AXIS 2 and apache CXF jars


steps 
download and Extract AXIS 2 jars
add jars to eclipse
create dynamic project
create a class with package and make Ws of that class to create WSDL file 
create WSDL  file using AXIS 2 implementation
Test WSDL URL



to add in eclipse go to preferences -> web services AXIS 2preferences 
browse location root directory of extracted folder

AXIS2 belongs JAX-WS so it has given some Annotations like @WebSERvice , @webMethod @webparam

so it is mandatory to add annotations if we are using AXIS2 but since we are using EClipse no need of it because Eclipse will add it for us
convert class to WS using AXIS2 implementation


in browser 

type
http://localhost:8081/CalServes/then 
click SERVICE you ca see all the SErvice your using in method





AXIS 2 WS Client USING eclipse

same AS AXIS 1 Client side WS
 
 create STUB in SRC using AXIS2 but this time class will be created but no argument constructor it will be having 3 inner class
 
 so in Test class 1st directly create the object of STUB class
 
 
 Then create the Object of Inner Class
 
 3 Inner class are 
 Add
 AddResponse
 ExtensionMapper
 
 add method having 2 parameter to set two required parameter need to create object of Inner class
 
 
 how many methods we have in Service method that many inner Class will be created in OUr STub CLass


create the object of Inner class using inner class set parameter the call Response of inner class ans set the values

Ru the Test CLass
